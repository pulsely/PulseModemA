## What is APRS

APRS stands for: Automatic Packet Reporting System.

APRS is a digital communications protocol that can exchanges information among large number of stations both local and global.

You as a licensed Amateur Radio operators can send and receive APRS location and message in 2 ways:

* Direct to the APRS-IS Network
* Radio Frequency with Amateur Radio at 2 meter band at 144MHz

### APRS-IS network

You can connect directly with the global APRS-IS network by Internet. Messages reaching the gateways will be relayed to the APRS-IS feed.

```
The PulseModem A will display messages from the APRS-IS, 100km around your current location.
```

### Radio Frequency with Amateur Radio at 2 meter band at 144MHz

APRS messages are short in length, in less than 100 bytes.

Messages are encoded in AX.25 protocol with Bell 202 AFSK modulation.

PulseModem A will play the encoded message through the audio port of your iOS device, to your radio.


## Roadmap for PulseModem A

The "A" of "PulseModem A" stands for APRS. Future versions of PulseModem will decode other formats.

PulseModem A aims to be the finest RF telemetry APRS & virtual TNC on iOS. The app will be updated as much as possible.

Below are the current roadmap of PulseModem A.

### 1. BLE Hardware Companion & PTT triggers

Given that the 3.5mm TRRS audio port has been removed from the current line-up of iOS devices, PulseModem A is expected to have a companion hardware in BLE4 for easy interface with commonly available VHF radios.

```
High on the list would be a proper PTT triggers for Baofeng, Kenwood & Yaesu radios.
```

### 2. Updated icons

The original APRS specifications have a limited set of icons.

That has been changed a few years ago, which gave rises to almost 1000+. PulseModem A aims to provide a more comprehensive support.

### 3. Better Messaging Parsing

Given that this is the first release of PulseModem A, there could be a myriad combinations of APRS messages that could trigger errors.

Along with other kinds of malformed messages from network or software errors...

This app will be updated with better message handling.
